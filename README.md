WMS App
======

This repository contains a cross-platform application built using .NET Core 7 and .NET MAUI.
It was designed for a WMS system to provide users with a mobile application, to use the camera's on the
mobile devices as a barcode scanner. 

It was built as an assignment for my studies at Avans Hogeschool for the Informatics study.
